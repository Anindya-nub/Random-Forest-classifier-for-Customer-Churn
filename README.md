# Customer Churn Prediction

This project analyzes customer churn data to predict which customers are likely to leave a service. It employs various data science techniques for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using historical data. Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a service. By analyzing patterns in customer behavior, this project aims to build a predictive model that helps businesses retain their customers.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and analyzing the data to understand patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features based on the existing data to improve model performance.
- **Modeling:** Applying machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models.
- **Other Libraries**: Such as datetime for time-based data manipulation.
